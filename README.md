RLBoot
======

RLBoot is meant to be a rewrite of [LBoot](https://github.com/farlepet/lboot)
in Rust. Mainly as a means to get some more hands-on experience with Rust, but
hopefully also add in some addition features that weren't implemented in LBoot.

It's kinda jank. Maybe it'll improve, maybe it won't.

NOTE: Currently, this requires building with a nightly Rust release.
